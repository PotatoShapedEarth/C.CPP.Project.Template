# C/C++ CMake project template

---

# 1 - How to use:

- Create a new project based on this template.
- Change the directories' names.
- Change the subdirectories' names in the root CMake.
- Change the name of the library in the main executable.
- *Remove the library for folder and subdirectory in root CMake if the file is just an executable, vice-versa if the project is just a library.*
